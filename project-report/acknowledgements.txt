ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

I'd like to acknowledge: 

[November 2023]
Prof. Dr. Birte Glimm (from Ulm University, Germany) for proposing to add a section on marking. It was now incorporated!

[April 2023]
Dr. Alban Grastien again! He noticed that in the "By" statement of the cover page only the "B" was in bold, not the y! :) Fixed now.

[February 2022]
Prof. Natalie Lloyd (from the ANU) for checking all the legal requirements (ANU rules) and looking from the perspective over the document that students from different schools might use this.

[December 2021]
Dr. Alban Grastien (from the ANU) also provided further corrections for a few remaining errors in a version that was considered final by me. :)

[December 2021]
Dr. Florian Geisser (from the ANU) for very detailed feedback on an early version of this document. This surely helped improving the document! 

I also thank all contributors to stackoverflow for an almost endless source of knowledge! :) Well, and openAI for chatGPT, which also contributed...
