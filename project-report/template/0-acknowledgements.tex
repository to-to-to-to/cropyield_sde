\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to express my profound gratitude to God, Allah SWT, for providing me with the strength, patience, and perseverance to complete this research.

I am deeply thankful to my supervisors, Dr. Ayman Elgharabawy and Dr. Brian Parker, for their exceptional guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the course of my research. Their invaluable insights and expertise in the field of neural networks and stochastic differential equations have been instrumental in the successful completion of this project.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose unwavering support and belief in my abilities have been a constant source of motivation. Their love and encouragement have been the foundation of my academic journey.

I am particularly thankful to my supervisors for their willingness to provide constructive feedback and for their availability despite their demanding schedules. Their dedication to my academic development has made this journey not only a learning experience but also an inspiring one.

I would also like to acknowledge the resources and support provided by the ANU Biological Data Science Institute and CSIRO, which have been crucial in conducting this research on "Crop-yielding Prediction using Neural Network for Stochastic Differential Equation Parameters Estimation."
