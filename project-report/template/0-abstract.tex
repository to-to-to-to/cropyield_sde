\chapter*{Abstract}

This study examines the challenge of precisely forecasting crop yields through the integration of neural networks and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The primary goal is to construct a predictive framework capable of accurately determining the parameters of SDEs that govern the dynamics of crop yields, especially in the presence of environmental variability. Through the utilization of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the research endeavor seeks to simulate and forecast the erratic patterns observed in crop yields, such as those of wheat, across temporal scales. The efficiency of the proposed model is assessed using both Euler and Stratonovich methodologies, which are essential for elucidating the impact of noise on crop yield prognostications. This novel methodology not only improves the precision of forecasts but also offers valuable insights into the stochastic mechanisms influencing crop yields, thereby advancing the effectiveness of agricultural planning and resource allocation.
