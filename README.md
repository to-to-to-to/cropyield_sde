Abstract: This research aims to investigate the complexities associated with the accurate estima-
tion of agricultural outputs through the integration of neural networks and stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). The principal objective is to develop a predictive frame-
work that is proficient in determining the parameters of SDEs governing the dynamics
of crop yields, particularly in the context of environmental variability. By employing
artificial neural networks (ANNs), this scholarly pursuit aims to simulate and project
the irregular patterns discerned in crop yields, such as those pertaining to wheat, over
various temporal dimensions. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated utilizing
both Euler and Stratonovich techniques, which are pivotal for clarifying the influence of
stochastic noise on crop yield predictions. This groundbreaking methodology not only
improves the precision of forecasts but also offers essential insights into the stochastic
processes influencing crop yields, thus aiding in the advancement of agricultural planning
and the optimal distribution of resources.
