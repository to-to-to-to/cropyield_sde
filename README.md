# Crop Yielding Prediction Using Neural Network and Stochastic Differential Equation Parameters

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project: **Crop Yielding Prediction Using Neural Network and Stochastic Differential Equation Parameters**.

The project explores the application of neural networks combined with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for predicting crop yields under varying environmental conditions. By leveraging both deterministic and stochastic modeling techniques, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of crop yield forecasts, particularly in uncertain environments such as Australia's agriculture sector.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use a combination of:
- **Neural Networks** to model complex relationships in crop yield data.
- **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)** to capture the uncertainty and variability inherent in agricultural production.
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and **Standard Brownian Motion (BM)** for long-term and short-term yield forecasting.

The project's main objective is to provide a reliable model for predicting future crop yields, considering both deterministic growth trends and random fluctuations caused by environmental factors.
