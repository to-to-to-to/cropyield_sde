% Short explanation:
% - Just like in PDDL, you have to define operator schema
% - Once that's done you can instantiate each schema multiple times in tikz pictures

% Two examples are provided below, both in the blocksworld domain
% - The first is the standard one with just one gripper; the (POCL) plan is totally ordered
% - The second has two grippers and thus allows a partial order.
% - You could also draw ordering constraints (not shown in the examples). The commands are:
%   * \orderingLeft{label}{label}
%   * \orderingRight{label}{label}
%   The difference between those is whether the arrow is bend down or up

\input{blocksworld-1-gripper}
\input{plan-1-gripper}

% make sure to only activate one of the domains at a time
% because the action names are the same

% UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING FOR SECOND EXAMPLE
%\input{blocksworld-2-grippers}
%\input{plan-2-grippers}
