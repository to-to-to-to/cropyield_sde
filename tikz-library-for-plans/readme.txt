The files in this folder are a self-written library -- aiplans -- for the LaTeX package tikz.
tikz is an extremely fancy package for "drawing"* graphs or pictures in LaTeX.
(The current manual, version 3.1.10 (15.1. 2023), has already more than 1300 A4 pages!)

Some useful resources to get started with tikz:
- An online version of the manual: https://tikz.dev/
- The PDF version of the manual: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf
- The package itself: https://texample.net/tikz/examples/

Anyway, my library aiplans offers support for drawing plans as often used in AI Planning.
Instructions for use and examples are given in the example document.

I (Pascal) have been using it in my publications, further example graphics can be found in
the following publications:  (the list isn't complete, these are just a few examples)

(*Well, you dan't "draw in tikz, you *code* your graphics. In fact, tikz is a recursive acronym
for "tikz ist kein Zeichenprogramm", which is Germam for "tikz isn't a drawing program".)
