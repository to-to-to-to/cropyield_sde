\section*{Abstract}
Crop-yielding prediction is a complex, multivariate, random, dynamic, and computationally intensive problem. This project employs a collection of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Itô form, using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the parameters of the SDE for the chaotic time series of wheat yield on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Our goal is to develop a novel and unique stochastic wheat model that provides the most accurate predictions based on SDE parameter estimation. The project will focus on defining new SDE parameters that can be accurately estimated using a neural network under specific noise level regimes to predict crop yield. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the European Commission’s MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), which includes data on spring barley, potato, grain maize, and sunflower. The historical data is available in both daily and yearly scales.
