\section*{Abstract}
Crops-yielding prediction is a multi-variant random dynamic and computationally expensive problem. 
This project employs a collection of stochastic differential equations (SDE) in Itô form using an artificial neural network (ANN)
to predict the parameters of the stochastic differential equation of the chaotic time series of wheat yielding daily, monthly,
and yearly. We aim to build a novel and unique stochastic wheat model that gives the best prediction based on SDE parameter 
estimation. The project will define new SDE parameters that can accurately be estimated in SDE using a neural network under 
specific noise level regimes to predict the crop yielding. The dataset used is the European Commission’s MARS Crop Yield 
Forecasting System (MCYFS) including spring barley, potato, grain maize, and sunflower. The historical data are in daily 
and yearly scales.
