\section*{Research Objective}
The objective of this research is to develop a high-performance wheat-yield prediction model for large-scale datasets using a stochastic approach combined with machine learning for parameter estimation. This method aims to significantly reduce computational time compared to traditional and deep neural network models, which often face overfitting issues due to unbalanced data.
