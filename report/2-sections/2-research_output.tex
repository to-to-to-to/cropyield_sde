\section*{Research Output}
In conducting this study, we will accomplish the following specific deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE) model tailored for crop yield prediction. This model will accurately forecast crop yields by incorporating innovative drift and diffusion functions.
    \item Identify and estimate a specific set of parameters within the SDE model that are crucial for accurate yield predictions. These parameters will be determined using advanced machine learning techniques.
    \item Design and implement new drift functions that represent the deterministic trends in crop growth and yield over time.
    \item Develop diffusion functions that effectively capture the stochastic nature and inherent variability in crop yield data due to environmental factors and other uncertainties.
    \item Validate the performance of the new SDE model through rigorous testing on extensive historical crop yield data, ensuring its robustness and reliability in various scenarios.
    \item Demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed model, showcasing its ability to handle large-scale datasets while mitigating common issues like overfitting, which are prevalent in traditional and deep neural network models.
