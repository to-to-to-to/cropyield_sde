\subsection*{Parameter Estimation}
Given a one-dimension time-homogeneous SDE:
\begin{equation}
    dX = \mu(X;\theta)dt + g(X;\theta)dW
\end{equation}
the task is to estimate the parameter $\theta$ from a sample of (N+1) observations $X_0, X_1, ..., X_n$ of the process at 
known times $t_0, t_1, ..., t_n$. In the statement of equation (1), $dW$ is the differential of the Wiener process 
(Brownian motion), $\mu(X;\theta)$ is the instantaneous drift, and $g(X;\theta)$ is the instantaneous diffusion.

\subsection*{Crop SDE Model}
The SDE model will propose new functions for the drift and diffusion SDE parts. The output model is evaluated by Euler and 
Stratonovich methods.
