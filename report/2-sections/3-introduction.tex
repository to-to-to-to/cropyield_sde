\section*{Introduction}
Crop yielding prediction is a complex problem. It is considered a multi-variant random dynamic system because it has hundreds of
factors based on weather, soil type, genotype, and phenotype variations. Those variations include almost thousands of factors.
Due to data scaling, this large data multi-variant is computationally expensive using traditional or deep machine learning 
because it has thousands of genotype, phenotype, and environment variable features. These invariant and hidden factors are similar
to stock exchange rate prediction.
